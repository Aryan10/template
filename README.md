# Competitive Programming Template

My personal C++ template library for competitive programming, containing optimized implementations of essential algorithms and data structures.

I also made an [extension](https://github.com/Aryan10/regionfold) to use with to auto fold template implementations

## üìö Modules

- **`math/`** - Essential mathematical algorithms including combinatorics, number theory, matrix operations, and bit manipulation techniques
- **`graph/`** - Comprehensive graph algorithms for connectivity, flow problems, shortest paths, and advanced graph operations  
- **`ranges/`** - Efficient data structures for range queries including segment trees, Fenwick trees, and square root decomposition
- **`string/`** - String processing algorithms for pattern matching, hashing, palindrome detection, and text analysis
- **`tree/`** - Specialized tree algorithms including LCA queries, tree decomposition, and hierarchical problem solutions
- **`utility/`** - Essential utilities with common macros, optimized I/O, custom data structures, and competitive programming helpers
