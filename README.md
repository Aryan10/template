# Competitive Programming Template

A modular, object-oriented and modern C++ template library for competitive programming, containing decently optimized implementations of essential algorithms, data structures and code snippets for utility.

I also made an [extension](https://github.com/Aryan10/regionfold) to use with to auto fold template implementations.

## üìö Modules

- **`math/`** - Mathematical algorithms including combinatorics, number theory, matrix operations, and bit manipulation techniques
- **`graph/`** - Graph algorithms for connectivity, flow problems, shortest paths, and advanced graph operations  
- **`ranges/`** - Data structures for range queries including segment trees, Fenwick trees, and square root decomposition
- **`string/`** - String processing algorithms for pattern matching, hashing, palindrome detection, z-function etc.
- **`tree/`** - Tree algorithms including LCA queries, tree decomposition, heavy light decomposition etc.
- **`utility/`** - Essential utilities with common macros, template I/O, hidden data structures, and competitive programming helpers
